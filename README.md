Utils to make it easy to call [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) in VSCode's extensions.

## Install

```bash
yarn add vscode-ripgrep-utils
```

## Usage

VSCode use `ripgrep` to search files. There is a `rg` binary in VSCode's installation directory, but the location differs on different platforms and different versions. This package provides a `getBinPath` function to get the absolute path of the `rg` binary.

```ts
import * as vscode from "vscode";
await getBinPath(vscode.env.appRoot);
```

Then you can use the high level `search` function to search files, or the low level `exec`/`execJson` functions to execute `ripgrep` with custom arguments.

```ts
import * as vscode from "vscode";
const bin = await getBinPath(vscode.env.appRoot);
await search({ bin, folder: "./", regex: "123" });
await exec(bin, "--version");
await execJson(bin, "-e 123");
```
